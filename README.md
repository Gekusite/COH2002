## Description
**Otterburg** is a Company of Heroes 2 map set on the banks of Saar river in famous Siegfried Line. On one side of the river lies town of Turdorf and on the other- medieval castle known as Otterburg. After the  Ardennes Counteroffensive, Allied forces finally reach a village of Turdorf and are about to launch an attack on heavily fortified Otterburg castle. As the castle serves Germans as headquarters, it's fall would temporary cripple German command in the region. Both Otterburg and Turdorf are complex and confusing environment full of blind alleys and narrow crossings. For armored vehicles it is a hard place to maneuver and for infantry it provides many opportunities for assaults and getaways. However, the outskirts around the castle and town are open, wide and excellent for armored combat.
